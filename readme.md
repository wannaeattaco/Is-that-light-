## Project overview and features
The purpose of this project is to measure light intensity and temperature in various learning environments, both indoors and outdoors, by using Kidbright's sensor. Also, data from the API is used to collect humidity and PM2.5 levels. We collect the data from 10.30 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. to determine the best timing and learning spaces for studying. We collect the light and temperature at:
* Co-working space on the third floor of the computer engineering building.
* Engineering library.
* KU main library.
* Economics Library.


## Required libraries and tools
* pymysql 
* uvicorn
* typing 
* fastapi 
* pydantic
